      <h3 class="hobbies-h3" style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">Virat woke up at 5a.m. He had a very bad dream. His body was feeling sticky due to sweat. It made him aware of his overgrown body and the fact that he was preparing for IIT. He lived in Kota, the capital of geeks in India. Everyone here prepared for IIT. They literally put their heart and soul in it. And more often than not even end up dying for it.
        <br><br>

Just a day before yesterday, Virat’s friend couldn’t cope up with the competition and decided to end it all. It all happened in the room next to his. The boy hanged himself to death. When Virat went inside the room to ask for chemistry notes, he saw his friend hanging. Virat, with a choking voice, called his name hoping that he will answer. But he didn’t. Virat went forward and touched his friend’s feet which were hanging just below his chin. They felt very cold. Tears roll down his eyes as he saw his friend’s face in the loop of death.<br><br>

Next day’s headline read- <br><br>
 KOTA BOY HANGS HIMSELF TO DEATH. <br><br>
 NONE TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE…. AGAIN.<br><br><br>

Indeed it was a tough life here and being average in studies did not help. Life here sucks, Virat thought. He was 3975th from the batch of 9750 that studied in his coaching institute. He did not like being ranked. (No one likes it, honestly.)<br><br>

Gazing at the red spread in the sky, Virat gave a thought about dying. The morning sun rose slowly in the sky and started to shine more brightly.  His thought was stretched for too long now. He realized this. The thought he uses to start his day with was death. And would continue to think of it all day whenever he had time. This became his favorite leisure time activity. With all the force he could muster, he pulled himself out of the dark space. He felt exhausted. He was very sick of this dark place he drifts in unknowingly. The thoughts were pleasing and terrible at the same time. But these thoughts made reality seem less-difficult.<br><br>

Virat decided to get his day going and pulled out some books from the pile. He started to browse the pages hoping to find something interesting. But he failed. He didn’t hate science this much when he was young. In fact, he loved it. In school, science was his favorite subject. But he hated it now. After struggling for some time, he surrendered himself to his thoughts of dying; how he would be free when he won't exist. It was already 7.30a.m. <br><br>

Virat had an off day today which meant double slogging. Teachers loaded them with assignments and question sets which would be enough for a lifetime. And to add to them were DPP ( Daily Practice Programme ) of all the three subjects which were to be solved daily. Virat hadn’t touched them from time immemorial. He knew he was being lousy and in this way, he was not going to make it to IITs."Leave IITs, this way I am not going to make it to any government college. And my dad won’t pay for private", he thought. He was on the verge of crying as he was taking out his assignments but somehow his eyes seem to disobey him. Tears seemed to have dried up. While he was pulling out the bunch of paper, his legs gave up on his enormous body and he fell on the ground. His knees were hurt but he didn’t care to have a look. The gulp in his throat made it difficult to breathe and speak. He somehow sat on his chair. There were still no tears in his eyes as if telling him to be strong. But he knew that he had been broken beyond repairs. <br><br><br>

From the window, he saw students lined up for extra class and doubt lectures. But he knew most of them went there for the air conditioner. They all were wearing the same uniform so that none of them could be distinguished. All of them were the same. Virat believed he was different when he was a child. But society did what it did best and made him believe that he was no different or special. The schooling system only helped the cause with their grades. He picked up his phone. It was 8.00 a.m. now. <br><br>

Sitting there on his chair, he felt nothingness inside him. How all this competition has reduced him to a globe of flesh which only eats and thinks about death. He knew he was dying slowly every day. Maybe that’s what struggle is. You have to do things you don’t love to get things you love, he thought. But he was very tired of everything. He hated his routine. He wondered how people managed to do the same things day after day. He certainly can’t do it. <br> <br>
"And that’s why you are fucked up. Your success is determined by what you do day in and day out… your success is determined by your routine", Virat's inner voice said. He didn’t know whether he was doing it wrong or the rules of being successful he knew were wrong..? <br><br>

Virat knew he had to do something or else he will simply perish as others. No matter how bad your life is, no one wants to die to escape from it. He knew what could possibly save him. It was her. He needed to talk. And no one understands him better than her. He met her when they were in school. They were in a very beautiful relationship. Whenever he thought of those days, he felt happy. He didn’t know why she left him. Might be because she thought long distance doesn’t work. Almost one and a half year had passed but he had never called her. But now he knew he had to. <br><br>

Virat picked up his phone and searched her number. His head was bursting with pain now and all he wanted was to talk to her. He dialed her number. This was the point he uses to back out every day. But today was different. He had to be selfish and talk to her because only she can save him. It was ringing and he felt goosebumps. Nobody was picking up. He thought of disconnecting but didn’t. “The number you are trying is currently busy,” the lady said. He put down his phone in despair. He received a message from her. It said <br><br><br>

 I don’t want to talk to you. I am sorry. Hope you are all right.
 <br><br>

Virat felt like dying.<br><br><br>

Virat had his writing pad in front of him. He remembered how much he loved to spill his emotions on paper and how much happiness it gave him. All he wanted was to be happy. He started to pen down his feelings. Pen felt a little heavy and words were hard to remember. But something inside Virat loved it. He started feeling better. He wrote- <br><br><br>

I knew that I am dying,<br><br>
Something in me said,<br><br>
Go ahead, die, sleep,<br><br>
 become as them, accept.<br><br>
Then something else in me said,<br><br>
 no, Save the tiniest bit.<br><br>
It needn’t be much,<br><br>
 just a spark.<br><br>
A spark can set a whole forest on fire.<br><br>
Just a spark,<br><br>
 save it.<br><br><br>


Virat felt more alive and more close to death at the same time. He can just feel it. He knew the world would call him a loser. But he just can’t take it anymore. He thought of his parents. He knew he would leave them in a mess after he is gone but he can do no good when he is alive. It was just too much for an 18-year-old to absorb and react to.<br><br>
Virat’s legs took his oversized body to his bed. And he drifted into the world of dreams.<br><br>

Virat knew he was dreaming. It was all darkness and loneliness surrounding him. He could feel the nothingness inside him. Virat felt his tiniest bit of living soul somewhere disappearing in nothingness. Who created this nothingness?? He thought.<br><br>
 Doing the work you hate doing can never bring you happiness no matter how honestly you do it. It will eat your soul and all that will remain will be nothingness.<br><br>

Virat now understands how to be happy and alive. Who is to be blamed? he didn’t know. All he wanted was to save himself. He was running in the darkness. But it seems to have no end. Virat knew this was it. He can't escape it now. He saw a light high up in the dark space. The light was slowly inching towards him. He took a deep breath. And suddenly the light was very close to him and it hit him with all the force in his chest. He could feel the pain. This would be the last thing he will ever feel. Virat was dead at last. <br><br><br>

Pain vanished as suddenly as it came. He could not fell his body. Virat was just reduced to a thought. He knew even this would not be there after some time. He tried to remember all his happy memories and he could remember them as vividly as ever. Virat saw his father in his usual clothes; looking happy. He felt happy seeing his father happy.  He saw his mother. She was wearing her Saari and bindi. She was looking beautiful. Why didn’t I ever told her this, he thought. And his little sister was looking as cute as ever. Virat never played with her because he studied all the time. First for the scholarship then for boards then for JEE. The rat race had made him miss so much in his life. He regretted it now.<br><br><br>

At last, Virat saw her. The only girl he ever loved. Even she was happy. Looking at her beautiful smile, he thought-"it’s worth dying now."<br><br><br>
